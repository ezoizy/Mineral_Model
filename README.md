[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

### Note
>This is a prototype application because at the time we are not using webservice,
because the cloud is not finished. So we deploy the tensorflow model inside this
application and results of detail is provided by data dummy inside this application.

### Overview
>Watuku is an application aimed to be used by university students, researchers, and
professionals for mineral detection, intended to be fast, cost-saving, and accurate.
This application use machine learning that is installed with the application on the
phone to detect the mineral from an image taken from camera or chosen from gallery and
then the cloud will provide the data of the detected mineral.
