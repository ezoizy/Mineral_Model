### Note
 This is a model for application **Watuku** . in this model we use Transfer Learning Inception-Res-Net-v2 . **Inception-ResNet-v2** is a convolutional neural architecture that builds on the Inception family of architectures but incorporates residual connections (replacing the filter concatenation stage of the Inception architecture). 

### Overview
 *Watuku is an application aimed to be used by university students, researchers, and
professionals for mineral detection, intended to be fast, cost-saving, and accurate.
This application use machine learning that is installed with the application on the
phone to detect the mineral from an image taken from camera or chosen from gallery and then the cloud will provide the data of the detected mineral.*
